# # The below is an example of using an end variable which is an optional parameter in print function
# print ("India is my", end= " ")
# print ("Country", end=" Vah !!!")
#
# # variable reuse with multiple datatype works in python
# a = 7
# print (a)
# a = "Benson"
# print(a)

#Lets see if contatenation of string an numbers work
# print ("Benson" + 7)
# Does not work

# # Let see the example of global and local variables
# f = 101
# print (f)
#
# def someFunction():
#     f = "Learning python for the first time"
#     print (f)
#
# someFunction()
# print (f)

# # Below is an example of accessing global variable inside a function
# f = 101
# print (f)
#
# def someFunction():
#     global f
#     f = 102
#     print (f)
#
# someFunction()
# print(f)

# # Variables could also be deleted Amazing
# f = 103
# print(f)
#
# del f
# print(f)
# # This gives an error saying variable is not defined
